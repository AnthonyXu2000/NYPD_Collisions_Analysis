# NYPD_Collisions_Analysis

I used Google BigQuery to conduct data cleaning, completed data analysis on the NYPD motor vehicle collision dataset to provide recommendation to reduce collision cases,
and created a dashboard that provides data summary and that can drill down by location, vehicle type, and contributing factor using the Looker Studio.
